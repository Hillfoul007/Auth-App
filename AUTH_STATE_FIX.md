# Authentication State Fix

## Issues Identified:

1. Authentication state not persisting after login
2. BookingFlow showing signin modal even when user is logged in
3. AccountMenu showing "Sign In" instead of user name

## Testing Steps:

1. Open browser console
2. Go to application
3. Click "Sign In"
4. Enter phone: +1234567890
5. Enter OTP: 123456
6. Enter name: John Doe
7. Watch console logs for authentication flow

## Debug Logs to Watch:

- "🎉 Login success! Received user:"
- "🔍 AccountMenu render - isLoggedIn:"
- "🎯 Booking button clicked!"
- "✅ State updated - isLoggedIn: true"

## Expected Behavior:

- After login, header should show "John Doe" instead of "Sign In"
- Booking flow should not show signin modal
- User state should persist across page actions
