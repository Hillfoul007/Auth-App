# Complete Setup Guide: Supabase + Google Maps Integration

This guide will help you set up the complete Supabase and Google Maps integration for the TaskApp platform with rider registration and location services.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account and project
- A Google Cloud Platform account
- Git installed

### 2. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Google Maps API Configuration
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key

# Optional: Backend API URL (if using custom backend)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### 4. Database Setup

#### Option A: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref

# Apply migrations
supabase db push
```

#### Option B: Manual SQL Execution

1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `supabase/migrations/004_create_location_tables.sql`
4. Execute the SQL

### 5. Storage Setup

In your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to Storage
2. Create a new bucket called `rider-documents`
3. Set the bucket to public or configure appropriate policies
4. Upload policies for authenticated users

### 6. Google Cloud Setup

#### Enable Required APIs

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
   - Distance Matrix API (optional)

#### Create API Key

1. Go to Credentials section
2. Create a new API key
3. Restrict the key to your domain(s)
4. Copy the API key to your `.env.local` file

### 7. Run the Application

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# The app will be available at http://localhost:8080
```

## üîß Detailed Configuration

### Supabase Configuration

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

The migration automatically creates RLS policies, but verify they're working:

```sql
-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('user_locations', 'location_search_history', 'riders', 'bookings');

-- Test policy (should only return your data)
SELECT * FROM user_locations WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

#### Storage Policies

Create policies for the `rider-documents` bucket:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own documents" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'rider-documents'
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Allow users to view their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own documents" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'rider-documents'
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
```

### Google Maps Configuration

#### API Key Restrictions

1. **Application restrictions**:

   - HTTP referrers: `localhost:8080/*`, `your-domain.com/*`

2. **API restrictions**:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API

#### Testing API Key

```javascript
// Test in browser console
fetch(
  `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA&key=${YOUR_API_KEY}`,
)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

3. **Location Accuracy**: Adjust GPS settings in `useLocation.tsx`

### Database Schema Changes

1. Create new migration files in `supabase/migrations/`
2. Update TypeScript types in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
3. Test migrations in development before deploying

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Google Maps API Not Loading

```bash
# Check browser console for errors
# Verify API key is correct
# Ensure APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
```

#### 2. Supabase Connection Issues

```bash
# Verify environment variables
echo $VITE_SUPABASE_URL
echo $VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Check Supabase dashboard for service status
```

#### 3. Location Not Detecting

```bash
# Ensure HTTPS in production (required for geolocation)
# Check browser location permissions
# Verify GPS/location services are enabled
```

#### 4. Database Migration Errors

```sql
-- Check current migration status
SELECT * FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations ORDER BY version DESC;

-- Reset migrations (CAUTION: This drops all data)
-- supabase db reset
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.setItem("debug-location", "true");
localStorage.setItem("debug-supabase", "true");

// Then refresh the page
```

### Testing Database Functions

```sql
-- Test find_nearby_riders function
SELECT * FROM find_nearby_riders(28.6139, 77.2090, 10.0);

-- Test distance calculation
SELECT calculate_distance_km(28.6139, 77.2090, 28.7041, 77.1025);
```
